Detecting Depression Using Text and Audio

📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting depression using machine learning and deep learning models by analyzing text and audio from clinical interviews. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech processing techniques to improve early diagnosis and mental health assessment.

🚀 Features

Multimodal Analysis: Uses both text and audio data for depression detection.

Text Processing: TF-IDF and Word2Vec-based text vectorization.

Audio Feature Extraction: MFCCs, pitch, and energy-based audio processing.

Machine Learning Models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Performance Optimization: Audio features improved model accuracy by 6-8%.
